## WebDistro
I made this project while learning docker. Basically, this application lets you create a docker session with your favorite linux based distro and then share that over the web to friends. Docker containers are auto cleaned when everyone leaves the session.

# Install
- Clone this repo
- Install docker & nodejs
- run 'npm install' in the WebDistro Directory
- start with 'node start.js'
